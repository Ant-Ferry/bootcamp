## Summary 

Welcome my friend! 

Since you got here, I believe you've already gone through the new employee entry procedure. And for those haven't, or even not being one of the
[zaoshu](https://zaoshu.io) family (yet), you're welcomed too! We'd love to show you our engineering culture, work flow and coding style.

## Engineering 

### Agile Development

We use scrum in daily development for software life cycle management...

### [Git](./engineering/git.md)

Codebase version control matters when we need to cooperate with multiple coders in a complex. We use Git(Hub) to do that and we wanna do better. 

### Unit Test 

We're not fans of TDD but we believe unit test is a necessity...

### Code Review

## Workflow

## Tech-stack Metrics

## Coding Style

> Coding style is like life style: Be brave and reckless to try and fail.
