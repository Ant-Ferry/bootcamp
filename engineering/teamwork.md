## Face2Face

Here for teamwork, we encourage you to go meet people face-to-face. Like my man [Richi](http://silicon-valley.wikia.com/wiki/Richard_Hendricks) said:
> _Face-to-face meetings make things better._

[_Ep 8 `White Hat/Black Hat` from Silicon Valley Session 2_](https://www.hbonow.com/series/silicon_valley/2/PROD776067/ep-8-white-hatblack-hat)

There're some reasons:

- Efficient: Face-to-face meeting tends to be more specific and infomation-intensive for in which situations there is more pressure to get to the point. 
- Engagement: Face-to-face ensures that people are "in the conversation" and focusing on what you want them to.
- Participation: There's always misjudgement of what things are critical right now to a person or how much shall a person being involved crossing multiple contexts, in which situations face-to-face meeting helps.

### How To

Just go and talk directly. If there's a gap ahead you've sensed, go find someone else (like your leader) togather.

### When To

We encourage you to go face-to-face with someone and don't interrupt others the same time. There're three ways to ensure that:

- Watch. If he/she is not coding or busy with something, go talk to him/her.
- Make a meeting plan with someone early.
- Direct message via [Slack](#slack) before you go to talk someone directly.

## Slack

We do asynchronous communications and machine messages integration on  [<img src="./img/teamwork-slack-logo-with-text.png" width="12%">](https://slack.com/), which is more like a hub of notifications all around engineering facilities and people.

### Direct Message

Talk to someone directly or command some bots to work for you via DM.

### Channel

Channel is like a lightweight group with specific topic and preset context. Here're some examples:

* `dev-talk`: R&D members talks about R&D things here.
* `dev-jenkins`: CI bots messages here. Every CI states changes of every projects will be notified. 
* `prd-talk`: Product releated topics. 

## Email

Nothing lasts forever there but Email. Talks and discussions may happen in face-to-face meetings and Slack, but shall be archived as Email at last, if the conversations and infomation are important.
