# Markdown

Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers created by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/).

Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

## What is Markdown?

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.

## GitHub Flavored Markdown

GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com. Details: [GFM](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown)
